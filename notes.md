# lerning HTML basics
- I jsut want a quick crash course as im in the middle of learning Reach and .JSX, which kinda mandates me to know some html syntax i think.
- lerning from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_EVuLegRZ0
- has a lots of tags but here are some basics and common ones for starters. 
- Before i list them all out, imma classify them into 3 main categories to remember easier
    - meta tags
    - layout tags
    - content tags

## meta tags
- <!Doctype html> : telling the browser that you're going touse html5
- <html></html> : telling the code where the html is starting ending
- <head></head> : just put extra and meta information about the html
- <title></title> : it will show up in search results
- <style></style> : this is where your CSS will be
- <link href="" rel="">: this is going to be an external link of your stylesheet
- <body></body> : the main content of the html. and for the browser to load
- <h1></h1> : heading 1
- <p></p> : paragraph (zdvise: to have 1 h1 per page?)
- <ul><li>...</li><li>...</li><li>...</li><li>...</li> ...... </ul> : listing
- <strong></strong> : 
- <em></em> : 
- <a href = "a link that can direct to another website or if you want to direct to a different part of yourwebsite, insert that part here by its div"> some text </a> : anchor tag
- <img src="url to the image" alt = "a description or caption"></img>
- <span> some words </span> :
